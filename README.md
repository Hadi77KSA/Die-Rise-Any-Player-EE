## Additional
### Trample Steam step: Maxis Side
- If the number of players is less than 4, the players will be able to obtain at least 4 trample steams from the equipment table during the Maxis Trample Steams step, but they must place one down before being able to equip the next one. Zombies will ignore your buildables during the step.
